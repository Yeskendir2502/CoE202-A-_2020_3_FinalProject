• The goal of this project is to design a convolutional neural network that can detect cancer in human tissue
images.
• For a successful surgery, it is critical to identify the exact location of the tumors so that the surgeon can resect
the tissue with a proper margin. Too small margin may increase the chance of the recurrence of the cancer
whereas too large margin may slow down or impede the recovery thereafter.
